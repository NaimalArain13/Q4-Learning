# OpenAI Agents SDK Project

## Overview

Welcome to the OpenAI Agents SDK Project! This repository is your guide to building smart AI helpers using the **OpenAI Agents SDK**. Whether you're a beginner who’s just starting with coding or an experienced developer, this project will show you how to create AI assistants that can answer questions, plan tasks, or even help with homework. It’s like giving your computer a super-smart brain!

The OpenAI Agents SDK is a Python tool that makes it easy to build AI agents. Want to learn more?

## What is the OpenAI Agents SDK?

The OpenAI Agents SDK is a Python library that lets you create **AI agents**—think of them as virtual assistants that can do things like suggest recipes, give study tips, or make to-do lists. It’s an improved version of a project called "Swarm" and is **open-source**, so anyone can use it for free and customize it.

With this SDK, you can build agents that:
- Answer questions like, “What’s a healthy snack?”
- Help with tasks like creating a workout plan.
- Work together as a team for bigger projects.

## Key Features of the SDK

Let’s break down the main parts of the OpenAI Agents SDK in a simple way:

### 1. Agent Class: The Blueprint for Your AI
The `Agent` class is like the recipe for your AI helper. It’s built as a **dataclass** in Python, which is a special way to store information neatly, like organizing toys in a box. Why use a dataclass?
- **Easy Setup**: It automatically creates tools to manage data, so you write less code.
- **Organized**: It holds important details like the agent’s instructions, AI model (e.g., GPT-4), and tools.
- **Time-Saving**: It simplifies coding, letting you focus on building cool agents.

For example:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Agent:
    name: str
    instructions: str
    model: str

This sets up an agent with a name, instructions, and model, all neatly organized.
2. System Prompt: The Personality
The system prompt tells the agent how to act, like saying, “You’re a health coach, give healthy tips!” It’s stored in the Agent class as instructions. Why?

Defines Behavior: It sets the agent’s role, like a teacher or chef.
Reusable: You set it once, and the agent follows it every time.

You can also make the system prompt a callable (a function) to create new instructions dynamically. For example:
def get_instructions():
    return "Suggest a healthy meal for today."

@dataclass
class Agent:
    instructions: str | Callable = get_instructions

This lets the agent adapt to different situations, like changing tips based on the day.
3. User Prompt and Runner Class: The Action
The user prompt is what you ask the agent, like, “Give me a salad recipe.” It’s passed to the run method in the Runner class, which is like a manager that runs the agent. Why?

Flexible Input: User prompts change every time, so they’re passed as a parameter.
Easy to Run: The run method is a classmethod, meaning you can call it without extra setup, like Runner.run().

For example:
from openai_agents import Runner

user_prompt = "Suggest a healthy salad recipe."
result = Runner.run(agent=health_agent, prompt=user_prompt)

The Runner handles all the technical stuff, like talking to the AI model, so you get the answer easily.
4. Generics and TContext: The Flexibility
Generics in Python are like magic boxes that can hold different types of data (like strings or lists) but ensure you use the right type. The SDK uses a generic called TContext to let agents work with extra information, like a user’s name or location. Why?

Adaptable: TContext lets the agent handle different kinds of data for different tasks.
Safe: It helps catch mistakes, like using a number when a string is needed.
Reusable: The same code works for many projects by changing the context type.

For example:
from typing import TypeVar

TContext = TypeVar("TContext")

@dataclass
class Agent:
    context: TContext  # Can be a string, dictionary, or anything

This makes the agent super flexible for all kinds of projects.
Why Use the OpenAI Agents SDK?

Beginner-Friendly: Simple to learn, even if you’re new to coding.
