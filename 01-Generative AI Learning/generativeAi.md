# 📘 Understanding Generative AI: A Complete Guide

## 1. What is AI?

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity, and autonomy.

## 2. What is Generative AI?

**Generative AI**, sometimes called **gen AI**, is [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence) that can create original content such as text, images, video, audio, or software code in response to a user’s prompt or request.

Generative AI relies on sophisticated [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/machine-learning) algorithms called [deep learning](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/deep-learning) models. These simulate the learning and decision-making processes of the human brain by identifying and encoding patterns in massive datasets to generate new, relevant content.

## 3. How Does Generative AI Work?

Generative AI operates in three key phases:

### 🔧 Training

* Involves creating a **foundation model**, a deep learning model trained on massive amounts of unstructured data (text, images, audio, etc.).
* The model learns through millions of prediction exercises (e.g., predicting the next word in a sentence).
* Training requires significant computational resources—thousands of GPUs and weeks of processing time.

### 🔧 Tuning

* Foundation models are generalists and need **tuning** for specific applications.
* **Fine-tuning** uses labeled data for accuracy.
* **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** improves models based on human evaluations of AI outputs.

### 🔁 Generation, Evaluation & Retuning

* Focuses on improving **quality**, **diversity**, and **speed** of AI-generated outputs.
* Continuous evaluation ensures outputs are accurate, relevant, and fast.
